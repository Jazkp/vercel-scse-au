        During my professional experience I have worked very closely with
        backend systems and languages. It was natural that during my programming
        studies, I focused more on what I already had a competitive advantage.
        My certifications at TAFE allowed me to explore the frontend in a
        different way, proving it could be also extremely powerful if used to
        its maximum potential. Vercel will allow me to dig and learn more about
        frontend, and especially Next.js
